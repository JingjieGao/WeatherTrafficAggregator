### Activities/Responsibilities In and/or Out of Scope

* Our team is focused on staying within the bounds of our project plan and also within the bounds of our individual abilities. The workload / tasks should be distributed evenly, but more importantly what each member feels comfortable in taking on. We want to provide a welcoming and judgement free environment that all members feel comfortable in and free to voice their thoughts, ideas, and opinions. 
If a member is struggling or feels like their load is too heavy etc., the team can discuss what needs to be done and to help. What would be considered out of scope would be the removal of core assets and assets created by a member other than self without discussion. The addition of assets without discussion is okay as long as major reconfiguration to the project is not required for integration
and the team is updated on the changes as soon as possible. 
  * For example: a member has an idea they think will be valuable for the project but it’s late at night & not a good time to meet for discussion, so they plan on updating the group in the morning.
