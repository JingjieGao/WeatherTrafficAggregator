### Team Purpose

* Our team sets out to accomplish the design and construction of a RESTful API service to provide users with weather & traffic data.

---

### Goals/Objectives

* Obtain a letter grade of ‘A’ on the team project

---

### Team Members and their Roles

* Alex Burgy: Meeting coordinator
* Jake Cipri: Notes keeper
* Jane Gao: Repository owner / manager
* Glynis Fisher: Meeting leader

---

### Activities/Responsibilities In and/or Out of Scope

* Our team is focused on staying within the bounds of our project plan and also within the bounds of our individual abilities. The workload / tasks should be distributed evenly, but more importantly what each member feels comfortable in taking on. We want to provide a welcoming and judgement free environment that all members feel comfortable in and free to voice their thoughts, ideas, and opinions. 
If a member is struggling or feels like their load is too heavy etc., the team can discuss what needs to be done and to help. What would be considered out of scope would be the removal of core assets and assets created by a member other than self without discussion. The addition of assets without discussion is okay as long as major reconfiguration to the project is not required for integration
and the team is updated on the changes as soon as possible. 
  * For example: a member has an idea they think will be valuable for the project but it’s late at night & not a good time to meet for discussion, so they plan on updating the group in the morning.

### Escalation Plan

    Step 1: Initial Check-In (Within 24-48 Hours of No Response) 

      Send a direct message (DM on Discord and Slack) asking if they’re okay and checking on their progress. 

      If no response, tag them in the team chat or project management tool (Discord/Slack). 

 

    Step 2: Team Discussion (After 48-72 Hours of No Response) 

      Bring up the issue in a team meeting. 

      Assign someone to try another contact method. 

      Assess if their absence is causing blockers and redistribute urgent tasks if needed. 

 

    Set 3: Notify a Professor (After 3-5 Days of No Response) 

      If the person is still unresponsive, inform Paula. 

      Decide whether to reassign their responsibilities permanently. 

 

    Step 4: Adjust & Document (After 1 Week of No Response) 

      Officially document their absence and any decisions made. 

      Reallocate remaining work across the team. 

      If they reappear, have a conversation about expectations moving forward.

### Development/Review/Branching Strategy

* Create a New Branch for Each Contribution
  * Every team member should create a new branch for each contribution they are working on. This ensures that each change is isolated and easier to manage.

* Review Pull Requests
  * At least one team member should review the PR before merging. All team members are responsible for reviewing PRs from others. Code reviews ensure quality, consistency, and help identify potential issues before merging into the main branch.

* Merge Changes to the Main Branch
  * Once the PR is reviewed and approved, the changes should be merged into the main branch.

* Close the branch
  * Close the branch if the team member feels that it is no longer necessary after merging. This helps keep the repository clean and organized.
