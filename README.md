# *Cloud Navigators - Team Project - Weather Traffic Aggregator*

---

### Problem Statement

Commuters and travelers face significant delays due to unexpected weather conditions and traffic congestion. Existing navigation apps provide traffic updates, but they do not always consider real-time weather disruptions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. Similarly, weather apps provide forecasts but do not account for how these conditions impact traffic flow. To address this problem, we will deploy an application called Weather&Traffic Aggregator. This intelligent navigation system will integrate real-time weather and traffic data, offering predictive route planning and weather impact alerts to improve travel efficiency and safety.

The service provides the following:
* Get current weather data for a specified location
* Get incidents by location and radius
* Get combined information by zipcode, location, and radius
* Post weather and traffic report
